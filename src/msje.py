    Activity Factors for Different Physical Activity Levels
    -------------------------------------------------------
	Sedentary:      Light physical activity associated with typical day-to-day life.
    Low Active:     Walking about 1.5 to 3 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour,
                    in addition to the light physical activity associated with typical day-to-day life.
	Active:         Walking more than 3 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour,
                    in addition to light physical activity associated with typical day-to-day life:
                    60 minutes of at least moderate intensity physical activity
    Very Active:    Walking more than 7.5 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour,
                    in addition to light physical activity associated with typical day-to-day life:
                    60 minutes of at least moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity
